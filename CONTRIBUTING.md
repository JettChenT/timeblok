# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in timeblok!
Here are some ways to start contributing to the project:
- Join our discord server: https://discord.gg/MXxsyAaeFg
- Open an [issue](https://github.com/JettChenT/timeblok/issues)
- Find an [issue](https://github.com/JettChenT/timeblok/issues) and contribute to the code

We're still in early stages of development, so there's a lot of work to be done. 
Feel free to ask me personally on the discord server or file an issue to discuss any ideas you have.

We're currently working toward [milestone 0.2](https://github.com/JettChenT/timeblok/milestone/1), 
but in the future I'm also considering adding a web interface via wasm, adding an integration with AI models like GPT,
and much more. So if you have any ideas, feel free to share them!
